## How I made it
I thought of a topic that the whole world needs to know at first I thought of turning plactic into reusable-paper then I was like how I the would would I do that.

My mum works with kids and the enviroment then I thought of a website that helps kid and adult 'but mostly kids' and thought of Sisters for Plant 'it is an instagram account about people donating money to grow trees in schools'.  

I then started coding a website that could help in collecting donations to plant tress in communities and schools.

## Languages used
-I used HTML to act us building blocks in my website.

-I used CSS to style my HTML and make it decorative and colorful.

-I used JSS to make the website funtional mostly in the donation section.JSS enables a donor to donate money and share their achievments.
